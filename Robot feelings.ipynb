    "The neurochemical networks that encode emotion and motivation from an evolutionary perspective provides a framework for thinking about the evolution of the brain neurotransmitter system. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, whereas emotion-inspired mechanisms can improve the way robots operate in a human environment with people. Such design is Kismet, which was made in the 90s by Dr. Cynthia Breazeal, a pioneer of social robotics and the human <-> robot interaction. Kismet recognizes and simulates emotions. Its social intelligence software system or synthetic nervous system (SNS) was designed with human models of intelligent behavior in mind. Cynthia Breazeal states that Kismet is not conscious, so it does not have feelings."

The universe occupies and constitutes space. It has three dimensions of length, breadth and depth. Add the dimension of time and the entire space will be a singular reality1. Now with the individual experience each person has of all that, we have a complete different reality2. No two people have the same set of experience and no two people have the same reality2. So, there are multiple experiences of what really exists. As different people have different beliefs about what is real, then we have already a different reality3. Different beliefs will produce different realities."

The materialists say that there is nothing but matter in motion and the metaphysicians maintain that there is nothing but ideas, mind and spirit. Could reality be something beyond the world of appearance or understanding? The study of the brain informs the social, communicative and adaptive aspects of emotion and offers support for the idea that we exploit our own psychological responses in order to feel others' emotions. What if, we consider a robot to have emotions, even though they not equal human emotions?"

Like Darwin proposed that species can change over time? It depends on the type and sensitivity of sensors included in its construction. By default, a robot's mind is strictly physical, a high level of brain functions. And throughout brain evolution, functional building blocks of neural network architectures with increasingly complex functional architecture, have emerged across species. Furthermore, with increasingly complex long-range connectivity ensuring \"information encoding\" in processing streams that are anatomically segregated at a cellular level."
