### I am always looking for the unseen and new ways to challenge my creativity

Extraordinary stuff in "Robot feelings" and (my feelings) after 2 job interviews in tech companies:
- the word $robot$ is a newcomer to the English language
- conversation from the 1920 play R.U.R. or Rossum's Universal Robots
- metaphysics refers to the branch of philosophy that attempts to understand the fundamental nature of all reality
- work in progress..

Why does the Alphabet of Life has 4 letters and 200 billion parameters?, looking for answers in "The Alphabet of Life":
- LLM & DNA decoding
- DNA is the data, epigenetics is the optimization
- training data and training ourselves
- work in progress..

"being feminine in the AI world", linked to unproductivity/infertility when placed in the wrong environment:
- men live in daily cycles
- women live in monthly cycles
- try to adapt something that is not adaptable
- work in progress...

### In fact...
...a Data Scientist deals, indeed, with metaphysics! We make the unseen, seen.
